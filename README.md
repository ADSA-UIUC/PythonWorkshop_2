Code for ADSA's 2nd workshop: Diving Deeper into Python

You can begin working by setting up the Python environment using MiniConda. The instructions to do so can be found here: [adsauiuc.com/workshops](http://www.adsauiuc.com/workshops/intro_big_data_python).

Start by working on the `dive_into_python.ipynb` notebook. This notebook features incomplete code where you can fill your code in and test as you go. The `completed_code.ipynb` file has all code examples completed for you to learn and test.
